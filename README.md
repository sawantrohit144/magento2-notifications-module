# Magento 2 Notification Module
This extension displays notifications to users via a bell icon in the frontend header. Admins can configure notifications for order placements, order shipments, discount coupons, and product back-in-stock alerts. This ensures that users stay informed about their orders, available discounts, and product availability updates.
